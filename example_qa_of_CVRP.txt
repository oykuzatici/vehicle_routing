Question: What happens if demand for customer1 increases by 20%?
Answer Code:
python
solve_vrp_with_demand_change(updated_demand={1: 1.20})
```
Answer:
With the updated demand, customer 1's demand has increased by 20%. The optimization yields a new minimum total distance of 4950.0, compared to the original 4807.0. This means the total distance increased by 143.0 units due to the higher demand.
